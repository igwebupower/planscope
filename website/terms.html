      <div class="legal-content">
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the PlanScope Chrome extension and website (the "Service"), operated by PlanScope ("we", "us", or "our").</p>

        <p>By installing the extension or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
        <p>PlanScope is a Chrome browser extension and web service that displays planning permission and related information for properties listed on third-party platforms such as Rightmove and Zoopla. The Service aggregates publicly available planning data from local authorities and other third-party sources and presents it in a consolidated and convenient format.</p>

        <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>these Terms of Service;</li>
          <li>our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>; and</li>
          <li>our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you use the Service on behalf of an organisation, you confirm that you have the authority to bind that organisation to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions and Licence Keys</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Free Tier</h3>
        <p>The free tier requires no account or registration. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>up to 10 property lookups per calendar month;</li>
          <li>basic planning application data; and</li>
          <li>local authority approval rate information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Usage limits are tracked locally within your browser and may change from time to time.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Paid Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>Paid subscription plans ("Pro" and "Team") provide additional features as described on our pricing page at the time of purchase.</p>
        <p>When you purchase a paid subscription, you will receive a licence key to activate the premium features in your extension. Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually in advance, depending on the plan selected. Prices are exclusive of any applicable taxes unless stated otherwise.</p>
        <p>Your licence key is personal to you and must not be shared with others.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hello@planscope.co.uk">hello@planscope.co.uk</a>.</p>
        <p>Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period. Your licence key will remain active until the end of that paid period, and no further charges will be applied after cancellation.</p>
        <p>All payments are non-refundable, including for partially used billing periods, except where a refund is required by applicable law.</p>
        <p>By purchasing a subscription and accessing the Service immediately, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the Service is a digital service supplied immediately upon purchase; and</li>
          <li>you lose your statutory 14-day right to cancel and receive a refund once access to the Service has begun, as permitted under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nothing in this section affects your statutory rights where the Service is not provided with reasonable care and skill or is materially different from its description.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use the Service for any unlawful purpose;</li>
          <li>attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Service;</li>
          <li>scrape, harvest, extract, or reuse data from the Service for commercial purposes without written permission;</li>
          <li>circumvent usage limits, access controls, or security measures;</li>
          <li>share licence keys with unauthorised users;</li>
          <li>use automated tools to access the Service beyond normal browser usage; or</li>
          <li>interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Accuracy and Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The planning data displayed by PlanScope is sourced from third-party providers, including local authority websites and government databases.</p>
        <p>While we strive to provide accurate information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>we do not guarantee the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of the data;</li>
          <li>planning data may be outdated, incomplete, or contain errors; and</li>
          <li>the Service is provided for informational purposes only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should always verify planning information directly with the relevant local authority before making property or investment decisions. The Service does not constitute professional planning, legal, or investment advice.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the Service is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranties of any kind;</li>
          <li>we disclaim all implied warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement;</li>
          <li>we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our total liability arising out of or in connection with the Service shall not exceed the total amount paid by you to us in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
        <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.</p>

        <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PlanScope, its directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your use of the Service;</li>
          <li>your breach of these Terms; or</li>
          <li>your violation of any third-party rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Service relies on third-party platforms and data providers. We are not responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the availability, accuracy, or reliability of third-party data;</li>
          <li>changes to third-party services that affect the Service; or</li>
          <li>third-party terms, policies, or practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We aim to provide a reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>
        <p>We may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>perform maintenance with or without notice;</li>
          <li>modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service; or</li>
          <li>restrict access to protect the integrity of the Service or enforce these Terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately if you breach these Terms or misuse the Service.</p>
        <p>Upon termination:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your right to use the Service will cease immediately; and</li>
          <li>any provisions which by their nature should survive termination will continue to apply.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of material changes by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>posting the updated Terms on this page;</li>
          <li>updating the "Last updated" date; and</li>
          <li>sending email notifications where appropriate.</li>

        <p>Continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.</p>
        <p>The courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Service.</p>

        <h2>14. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and PlanScope regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements or understandings.</p>
